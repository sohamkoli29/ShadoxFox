        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Soham Suraj Koli, and I am from Alibag, Raigad. I am currently a second-year student at PCET’s Pimpri Chinchwad University, where I am pursuing my passion for programming and web development.</p><br/><br/>
        <p>Ever since I was introduced to programming, I have been fascinated by the endless possibilities it offers. This interest has led me to dive deeper into web development, where I can combine my technical skills with creativity to build engaging and functional websites.</p><br/><br/>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have several personal interests that keep me active and challenged. I can solve a Rubik's cube, which has taught me the value of patience and problem-solving. I am also an avid chess player, constantly strategizing and thinking several moves ahead. Swimming is another activity I enjoy, providing a perfect balance to my intellectual hobbies.</p> <br/><br/>
        <p>Through my web development journey, I aim to create impactful projects that not only demonstrate my skills but also contribute positively to the community. I am excited about the future and eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.</p>
